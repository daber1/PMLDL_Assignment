# Title: Report on My Path in Solution Creation Process

## Introduction:
This report outlines my journey and decision-making process in creating a solution for a specific problem. Initially, I explored dictionary-based solutions and subsequently conducted research using online resources and chat with GPT to develop a final solution based on a seq2seq model architecture.

1. Dictionary-Based Solution:
To kickstart my solution creation process, I began by implementing a basic dictionary-based approach. This involved constructing a mapping of input words or phrases to corresponding outputs. While this solution might suffice for simple and limited use cases, it typically lacks the flexibility and adaptive capabilities required for more complex problems.

2. Research:
To enhance my solution and tackle more intricate challenges, I conducted research to explore alternative approaches. My research involved the following:

2.1. Googling Similar Problems:
By searching for similar problems online, I aimed to find existing solutions or gain inspiration from related work. This method allowed me to study different architectures and understand their pros and cons in solving similar problems.

2.2. Consulting ChatGPT:
I utilized chat GPT to seek further guidance and insights. Engaging in a conversational manner with the model provided me with helpful suggestions, directions, and potential architectures to explore, one of which was the seq2seq model.

3. Seq2Seq Model Selection:
Based on my research and conversations with ChatGPT, I decided to proceed with a seq2seq model architecture as the foundation for my final solution. The seq2seq model encompasses an encoder-decoder structure and is particularly suitable for tasks involving natural language processing and language generation. It allows for input sequences of variable lengths and generates corresponding output sequences.

4. Architectural Design and Implementation:
Having chosen the seq2seq model, I developed the architectural design to address the problem at hand. This involved:

4.1. Encoder:
The encoder component takes the input sequence and processes it, often using techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, to create a rich representation of the input.

4.2. Decoder:
The decoder component takes the encoded representation and generates the desired output sequence. It operates in an autoregressive manner, predicting one element at a time while incorporating attention mechanisms to capture relevant details.


## Conclusion:
In summary, my solution creation process started with a basic dictionary solution and progressed through research, architectural selection. By leveraging the seq2seq model architecture, inspired by research and guidance from ChatGPT, I created a basic but not good enough solution for the given problem.
